/**
 * The [split] function is used to group the elements emitted by the current [Flow] into smaller Flows based on the provided
 * [GroupStrategy]. This function is useful when smaller Flows are preferred over the original one, some scenarios include
 * file processing, database operations, and so on.
 *
 * The smaller streams are emitted as [Flow] of elements, with each group containing a maximum number of elements or a time window,
 * depending on the provided [GroupStrategy] implementation.
 *
 * The available strategies include:
 *  1. [GroupStrategy.Count]: Groups the input flow based on the number of items in each chunk.
 *  2. [GroupStrategy.TimeWindow]: Groups the input flow based on a specified time duration.
 *
 * Note that the streams may not be of exactly the same size, depending on the number of elements emitted and the
 * specified strategy. However, the order of elements in the output flows is preserved from the input flow.
 *
 * @param strategy The [GroupStrategy] implementation to be used for grouping the elements.
 *
 * @return A [Flow] of [Flow]s, where each one represents the smaller [Flow]s of elements from the original flow.
 *
 * Example usage:
 * ```
 * val flow: Flow<Int> = flowOf(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10)
 * val chunkSize = 4
 *
 * flow.split(GroupStrategy.Count(chunkSize))
 *     .collectIndexed { index, smallerFlow ->
 *         print("Flow #${index + 1}: ")
 *
 *         smallerFlow
 *             .intersperse(", ")
 *             .collect(::print)
 *
 *         println()
 *     }
 *
 *  // Output:
 *  // Flow #1: 1, 2, 3, 4
 *  // Flow #2: 5, 6, 7, 8
 *  // Flow #3: 9, 10
 * ```
 *
 *  In this example, the input flow contains 10 elements. The [split] function is called with a size of 4. This means that
 *  the output flow will emit the [Flow]s, each one containing at most 4 elements.
